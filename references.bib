                sequences exactly and resolves differences of as little as 1
                nucleotide. In several mock communities, DADA2 identified more
                real variants and output fewer spurious sequences than other
                methods. We applied DADA2 to vaginal samples from a cohort of
                pregnant women, revealing a diversity of previously undetected
                Lactobacillus crispatus variants.",

    abstract = "SUMMARY: Microbiome research is now moving beyond the
                compositional analysis of microbial taxa in a sample. Increasing
                evidence from large human microbiome studies suggests that
                functional consequences of changes in the intestinal microbiome
                may provide more power for studying their impact on inflammation
                and immune responses. Although 16S rRNA analysis is one of the
                most popular and a cost-effective method to profile the microbial
                compositions, marker-gene sequencing cannot provide direct
                information about the functional genes that are present in the
                genomes of community members. Bioinformatic tools have been
                developed to predict microbiome function with 16S rRNA gene data.
                Among them, PICRUSt2 (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities
                by Reconstruction of Unobserved States) has become one of the
                most popular functional profile prediction tools, which generates
                community-wide pathway abundances. However, no state-of-art
                inference tools are available to test the differences in pathway
                abundances between comparison groups. We have developed
                ggpicrust2, an R package, for analyzing functional profiles
                derived from 16S rRNA sequencing. This powerful tool enables
                researchers to conduct extensive differential abundance analyses
                and generate visually appealing visualizations that effectively
                highlight functional signals. With ggpicrust2, users can obtain
                publishable results and gain deeper insights into the functional
                composition of their microbial communities. AVAILABILITY AND
                IMPLEMENTATION: The package is open-source under the MIT and file
                license and is available at CRAN and
                https://github.com/cafferychen777/ggpicrust2. Its shiny web is
